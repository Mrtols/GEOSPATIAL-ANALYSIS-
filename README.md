# GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS OF GLOBAL GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSION &amp; WORLD POPULATION

This project is about the Geospatial analysis of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2) and understanding the spread of the emission in some Countries.

The population of these countries around the world is considered to understand the extent of gas emissions from 2000 to 2010. Also, the percentage change in greenhouse gas emissions over these years is analysed. Furthermore, the correlation between the mean greenhouse gas emissions and the mean population is Analysed.

All ANALYSIS and VISUALIZATION are done using python based Libraries like Geopandas, matplotlib on jupyter notebook.
